STILL WIP, but less likely to update (because author sucks at rigging) so feel free to download and/fork to try out.

This is a convert to Blender 4.2/modification of the 2D StickMan Rig v3 by [energiesgraphiques](https://blendswap.com/profile/40739) which was originally developed by [LDev](http://www.blendswap.com/user/LDev)

It has 4 file

- **BlackStickTemplate** is the stripped bare bone armature, useful for furthure modification
  ![BlankTemplate](./screenshots/BlankTemplate.png)
- **MeshTectureEditForTemplate** is the Mesh one, except the material has been setup for texture paint cutout
  ![TextureTemplate](./screenshots/TextEditing.png)
- **GPLayerLinkedTemplate** is grease pencil rig based on grease pencil layer relation
  ![BlankTemplate](./screenshots/LayerEditing.png)
- **GPVertexGroupTemplate** is grease pencil rig based on Vertex Group
